# The Weather Task (ES6)

This app uses:

*  Angular Material
*  D3
*  Angular Components
*  Theming can be altered/configured using `$mdThemingProvider`


##### Getting Started

This project uses [jspm.io](http://jspm.io), a package manager for SystemJS which is built on top
of the dynamic ES6 module loader. This allows developers to load any module format (ES6, CommonJS,
AMD, and globals).

###### Prerequisites

This project assumes that you have NodeJS and any relevant development tools (like XCode) already
installed.
 
###### Getting Started

Clone this repository and execute the following commands in a terminal:

* `npm install jspm live-server -g`
* `jspm update`
* `live-server --open=app`

> **Note:** You should use a web-server (like live-server above) to view your app in the browser. Open
  the dev console to see any warnings and browse the elements.

#### Troubleshooting

If you have issues getting the application to run or work as expected:

1. Make sure you have installed JSPM and run the `jspm update` command.
2. Reach out on our [Forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ngmaterial) to see if any other
   developers have had the same issue.
3. This project is based against the `master` branch of Angular Material, so it is always showing
   the latest and greatest. You may want to update the `package.json` to use Version 1.1.0 or
   another stable release to make sure it isn't because of something we changed recently.
4. Search for the issue here on [GitHub](https://github.com/angular/material-start/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen).
5. If you don't see an existing issue, please open a new one with the relevant information and the
   details of the problem you are facing.
