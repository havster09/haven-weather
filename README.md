# The Weather Task (ES6)

This app uses:

*  Angular Material
*  D3
*  Angular Components


##### Getting Started

This project uses [jspm.io](http://jspm.io), a package manager for SystemJS which is built on top
of the dynamic ES6 module loader. This allows developers to load any module format (ES6, CommonJS,
AMD, and globals).

###### Prerequisites

This project assumes that you have NodeJS and any relevant development tools already
installed.
 
###### Getting Started

Clone this repository and execute the following commands in a terminal:

* `npm install`
* `npm install jspm live-server -g`
* `bower install`
* `live-server --open=app`

> **Note:** You should use a web-server (like live-server above) to view your app in the browser. Open
  the dev console to see any warnings and browse the elements.
